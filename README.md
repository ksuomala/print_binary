# print_binary
Prints any variable type (size &lt;=64) in binary to the standard output.
First argument should be the size of the second argument variable in bits. This should be a multiple of 8 and no more than 64.
If the second argument is a string, size_in_bits should be set to 0.


```C
void	ft_print_binary(int size_in_bits, ...)
```

The code should be included and compiled in your own repository.
